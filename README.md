### Day Planner

### Description
The goal of this project is to create a working day planner on a webpage that allows the user to add events to each one hour time block and save the text to local storage. When the page is reloaded the previously entered text should be saved a show up. The date should display at the top of the page. Each hour block is color coded based on the current time. Red indicates that it is the current hour, green indicates future, and gray indicates past.
